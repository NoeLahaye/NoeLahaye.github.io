_This webpage is still under construction_

I am a researcher in Physical Oceanography, working at Inria (Rennes, France). 

I am interested in ocean turbulence -- more globally Geophysical Fluid Dynamics --, and work mostly on internal waves and internal tide dynamics. 

To this aim, I construct and analyze conceptual models, run and analyze high-resolution numerical simulations in realistic or idealized configuration, and use actual data from observations as well.
